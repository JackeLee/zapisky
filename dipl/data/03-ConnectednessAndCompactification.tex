\begin{lemma}
    The following are equivalent:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Closure of each open sublocale is open.
        \item $\closure{\mathfrak{o}(a)} = \mathfrak{o}(a^{**})$.
        \item $a^{**} \vee a^* = 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}\label{p:extrDiscPreserv}
    Let $L$ be a extremally disconnected frame, then $\R L$ is also extremally disconnected.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
    For zero--dimensional frames, it is not always the case that compactification preserves zero--dimensionality. Frames in which this is true are called strongly zero--dimensional.
\end{remark}
