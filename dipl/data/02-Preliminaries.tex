\chapter{Preliminaries}
    We assume basic knowledge of Set Theory, mainly basic knowledge about cardinals and cardinalities, "axiom of choice".

\section{Partially ordered set}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Joins, meets, order, lattice, complete lattice, distributive lattice (unique solution to $a\vee x = b$ and $c\wedge x = d$)
    \item $\kappa$--complete and complete lattices and lattice homomorphisms % TODO check, we have already defined it in "Parts of duality"
    \item meet/join semilattice
    \item bottom (0) resp. top (1) and $0_S$ resp. $1_S$
    \item Galois correspondence (equivalent definitions)
    \item filters, ideals, principal filter/ideal
    \item pseudocomplements and complements (complemented elements)
    \item \num\label{p:pseudcomplProperties} $(a \wedge b)^{**} = a^{**} \wedge b^{**}$, $a \leq b \implies a^* \geq b^*$.
    \item \num\label{p:rbellowProperties} $a_1\wedge a_2 \rbelow b_1 \wedge b_2$ and $a_1\vee a_2 \rbelow b_1 \vee b_2$ for $a_i\rbelow b_i$
    \item \num\label{p:crbellowProperties} $a_1\wedge a_2 \crbelow b_1 \wedge b_2$ and $a_1\vee a_2 \crbelow b_1 \vee b_2$ for $a_i\crbelow b_i$

                                        $a \crbelow x\crbelow y\crbelow b$ implies $b^* \crbelow x\crbelow y\crbelow a^*$
    \item Boolean algebras and Boolean homomorphisms, \DEF{\Bool}, prime/maximal/ultrafilter on BA
    \item Axiom of Choice/Zorn's Lemma, Boolean Ultrafilter Theorem
    \item Heyting algebras, $\_^* = \_ \to 0$
\end{itemize}
\section{Category Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item category (in basic definition locally small), demonstrative  examples using categories from previous section (most importantly \Bool), dual category??
    \item functor (important example: identity functor and constant functor), covariant, contravariant
    \item natural transformation, natural equivalence, functor category
    \item limits/colimits via "universal functors", example products, sums
    \item ajdunction only via units and counits of adjunction

    explain importance of adjunction by mentioning the limit preserving
\end{itemize}

\section{Topology and point--free Topology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic of \Top{} and \Frm. frame homomorphisms, localic maps, continuous map, homeomorphism
    \item Subspace and sublocale/subframe, dense sublocale, empty frame (\emptyFrm), co-frame of sublocales (we will need its distributivity), $\iota_S\colon L \to S$ as subframe inclusion and as onto frame homomorphisms? (the next part needs it)
    \item Separation axioms (regularity, complete regularity, normality, ...?), rather below (and useful facts about them)

    Again, as for topological spaces, we have:

        \num\label{p:normalRegular} Any normal and regular frame is completely regular: For $x\rbelow y$, the $x^*\vee y = 1$ holds, from normality there exists a $q$, such that $x^*\vee q = 1$ and $q^*\vee y = 1$, thus $x\rbelow q\rbelow y$. So $\Set{x | x\rbelow b} = \Set{x | x\crbelow b}$

    \item completeness and cocompleteness of \Top{} and \Frm{}
    \item Spatiality, some spatiality theorems (II.5.3, Hofmann--Lawson's Duality)
\end{itemize}

TODO place somewhere StoneSp and StoneFrm and \J.

Notation.
$\downset a^*$ means $\downset (a^*)$ (rightmost unary operator applies first)

For the definition of frames, we see that $\wedge$ is the left/right Galois adjoint, therefore every frame is a complete Heyting algebra, moreover also a pseudocomplemented lattice. The pseudocomplement operation for open set in spacial frames corresponds precisely to the complement of the closure of that set, or the interior of the complement.

\begin{definition}
    Let $L$ be a locale, \DEF{nucleus} $\nu$ on $L$ is a monotone map $\nu\colon L \to L$ having the following four properties:
    \begin{enumerate}[(N1)]
        \item $a \leq \nu(a)$,
        \item $a \leq b \implies \nu(a) \leq \nu(b)$,
        \item $\nu\nu(a) = \nu(a)$, and
        \item $\nu(a \wedge b) = \nu(a) \wedge \nu(b)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\num\label{p:nuclProp} \textbf{Properties of nuclei.} For a locale $L$ and a nucleus $\nu\colon L \to L$, set $S = \nu(L)$. The set $S$ together with suprema and infima defined
    $$ \bigsqcup a_i = \nu(\bigvee a_i)\quad\text{ and }\quad a \sqcap b = a \wedge b$$

\noindent is a sublocale of $L$. Indeed, we have
$$ (\bigsqcup a_i)\sqcap b = \nu(\bigvee a_i) \wedge \nu(b) = \nu(\bigvee(a_i \wedge b)) = \bigsqcup (a_i \sqcap b).$$

\noindent From (N4) we know, $\sqcap$ is the infimum and from (N2) we know $\bigsqcup$ is the supremum. Hence $\nu(L)$ is a locale, to show that $\nu(L)$ is a sublocale of $L$ for $\nu^*\colon L \to \nu(L)$, defined $a \mapsto \nu(a)$, we will show it is an onto frame homomorphism. It is enough to show
    $$\nu(\bigvee a_i) = \nu(\bigvee \nu(a_i)) \quad( = \bigsqcup \nu(a_i)).$$

    \noindent We have $\bigvee a_i \leq \bigvee \nu(a_i)$ by (N1) and $\nu(\bigvee a_i) \leq \nu(\bigvee \nu(a_i))$ by (N2). On the other hand $\nu(a_i) \leq \nu(\bigvee a_i)$ by (N2). Hence $\bigvee \nu(a_i) \leq \nu(\bigvee a_i)$ and $\nu(\bigvee \nu(a_i)) \leq \nu\nu(\bigvee a_i) = \nu(\bigvee a_i)$ by (N2) and (N3).
