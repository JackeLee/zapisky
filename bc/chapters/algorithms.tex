\section{Description of the AlphaBeta search}
Alpha-Beta search is search algorithm used in minimax trees. The main purpose
of algorithm is to reduce number of branches and nodes to be visited. The idea
of algorithm is modified Depth First Search and works as follow:
....

As can be seen, if AlphaBeta finds solution for depth n, than it is the best
solution in MiniMax tree for depth n.

AlphaBeta search has grown in popularity in game of chess. Until now all
successful arimaa bots were using it with various enchants.


\section{Description of the Monte Carlo Tree search}
We presume the reader is familiar with rules of the game Go. {???}

The first attempts to use random approach as evaluating approximation of the Go
position were in 1993 [BERND]. Generalised Bernd's algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Play random game from given position with one exception, choose only
	  steps not filling eyes. At the end of simulation count in the result of
	  simulation for the first step played.
\item If there is time left go to 1.
\item Choose move with highest ratio between number times the move won when it
	  was played and the number of times it was played.
\end{enumerate}

Playing random simulation is also called playout.

definition one handed bandit problem

We use Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm as is described in [???] and also
modified by Kozelek.


UCB1 algorithm is algorithm for playing multi-armed bandit problem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Play each arm of the bandit once.
\item Play arm maximizing the formula $\overline X_i + \sqrt{2 \log n \over n_i}$,
	  where $\overline X_i$ is average value of the arm $i$, $n$ is number
	  of games that were played by parent of the $i$ and $n_i$ is number of
	  games played with arm $i$.
\end{enumerate}

Upper Confidence bounds algorithm applied to Trees (shortly UCT algorithm) is
algorithm traversing built multi-armed bandit tree using UCB1 formula.

	

Standalone UCT needs set of carefully chosen extensions to be competitive. The
MCTS is some variant of UCT algorithm with those extensions.
