\chapter{Introduction}
After first computers were created it was always in human target to compete
human mind in every occasion. First significant result was shown in 1997. IBM's
employees constructed a computer named Deep blue with just one purpose, to
defeat Gary Kasparov -- the best human player in the game of chess.

After Gasparov was defeated, new challenges has come. Defeat men in Go. Until
now, there were no significant success on standart 13$\times$13 board. But many
useful new way of playing games was invented. In 2006 Monte Carlo methods were
used to defeat all other computer players of Go. After that day all successful
programs were using Monte Carlo methods~\cite{MoGo}.

We will introduce the game of Arimaa and describe two algorithms \ac{MCTS} and
the AlphaBeta search with various of extensions.

\item[Game tree] for arbitrary game is tree with starting positions as root and

\item[Evaluation function] is function which estimates value of given position of the game. It can be used for example to compare which of two given positions is better.
\item[Minimax tree] for two player game is game tree limited to some depth with
added values in all nodes. Values are defined recursively. In leaf of the tree
is value calculated by evaluation function. In nonleaf node is the value
defined as the best value from nodes children from nodes active player point
of view.

\section{The Game of Arimaa}
\begin{flushright}
\emph{"Even simple rules can lead to interesting games."\\
--- Omar Syer}
\end{flushright}

The game of Arimaa is a pretty new game. It is carefully designed to be hard to
play for computers, but easy to play for humans. Creator of the game Omar Syed
says that Gasparov was not oversmarted but overcomputed~\cite{arimaa.com}.


The game was carefully designed in order not to be possible to use methods
well known from Chess as game-ending tables or opening tables. 

The rules of the game are so simple that even small kids can play it.

\section{Rules of the game~\cite{arimaa.com}}
Arimaa is a two-player zero-sum game with perfect information. It is designed to
be possible to play it using the board and pieces from chess set. The starting
player has Gold color, second is Silver. In the zeroth turn Gold and then
Silver player each place all their pieces into first two (for Gold) or last two
(for Silver) lines of the board any way they consider appropriate. Piece set
consist of eight Rabbits, two Cats, two Dogs, two Horses, Camel and Elephant in
order from weakest to strongest.

%% TODO example picture of the starting position

Players are taking turns starting with Gold. In each turn a player makes move,
which consist of one to four steps. Player may \emph{pass} and do not use
remaining steps. After move ends, the position of the board must be different
from the position before move started.

Figure is considered frozen if on one of its neighbouring squares is opponent's
stronger piece, and on no figure sharing color with it. Adjacent or neighbouring
squares are those squares lying in one position to left, right, front or
backwards.

%% TODO example picture of the frozen piece and possibility to push and pull

To make step player chooses one of its non frozen figures and move it to one of
the free adjacent squares, with one exception -- rabbits cannot step backwards.
Instead of making a simple step player can provide pull or push. Pulling is
almost identical to the simple step, but after step is done player choose one
of the weaker piece which stayed on neighbouring of the square from which
figure moved, and move it to position from which our piece stepped. Pushing is
a kind of opposite to pulling. At first neighbouring weaker piece is moved to
its free adjacent square and then our piece is placed to weaker pieces former
place. Push and pull counts as 2 steps and can not be combined together.

On the board are four special squares called traps in positions \texttt{c3},
\texttt{c6}, \texttt{f3} and \texttt{f6}. After each step ends if any piece is
in trap and has no adjacent piece sharing color with him, it is trapped and
therefore removed from the board.

At end of the move it is checked if game ended and it happens if one of the
following conditions is fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{scoring goal:} one of the players rabbit has reached opponent's front line (goalline),
\item \emph{elimination:} one of the players has no rabbit left,
\item \emph{immobilisation:} the next active player cannot move,
\item or the same position is repeated in third time in the row.
\end{enumerate}

Player wins if he scores goal or opponent is eliminated, immobilised or
repeated position for third time.

\section{Comparison to Go and Chess}
Because Arimaa is played with full chess set it is very natural to ask about
similarities with the game of Chess. As in Chess is in Arimaa also so easy to
ruin good position with just one bad move. For example stepping out of trap an
therefore let another piece to be trapped or unfreezing rabbit near goalline.
Unlike in Chess starting position is not predefined and there are about
$4.207\times10^{15}$ different possible openings which makes it hard for arimaa
bot programmer to use any kind of opening tables~\cite{COX}.

In Arimaa it is also very hard to build a good static evaluation
function~\cite{WorldChampion}. Even human players often do not know for example
if in certain position it is better to sacrifice a Camel for trapping an
opponent's Horse and a Cat and often it depends on many other factors. Building
good evaluation function is very hard in game of Go also, because it requires a
lot of local searching to find territories and determine their potential
owners. On the other hand destroying good position by making wrong step is in
Go a lot harder.

In the game of Go if we omit filling \acsp{Eye}, then any random playing sequence
leads to end, which is not so easily achievable in Arimaa and Chess. Christ Cox
showed in his work that in Arimaa branching factor of average position is
around 20,000. With comparison in Chess it is only 35 and in Go 200~\cite{COX}.

\section{Challenge}
Omar Syed decided to left a prize 10,000 USD for programmer or group of
programmers who develop Arimaa playing program which win Arimaa Computer
Championship and then defeat three chosen top human players before the year
2020. Omar Syed believes that this motivation will help further improvements in
area of AI game programming~\cite{syed}.

So far computers were not even close to defeat one of the chosen human
players~\cite{arimaa.com}. ... (TODO add facts)

\section{Object of research}
Tomáš Kozelek has shown in his work, that building Arimaa playing program using
MCTS is possible. In this work we will focus on comparing capabilities and
perspectives to the future given by AlphaBeta search and MCTS in game of
Arimaa.

The main part of this work is to develop Arimaa playing program and try to
answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is MCTS competitive alpha beta search at all?
\item Is MCTS more promising engine than AlphaBeta search in the future with
      increasing number of cpus?
\item How important is evaluation function in MCTS compared to AlphaBeta?
\end{enumerate}
% TODO: which area should be compared? who is more perspective in future?
