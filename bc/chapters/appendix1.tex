\chapter{Appendix 1}\label{statistics}

In our development we used GHC as a Haskell compiler. The following statistics
were taken by compiling bots with \texttt{-prof -auto} options and ran with
\texttt{+RTS -p} parameters.

\subsubsection{Statistics of the AlphaBeta search}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Statistics of the Monte Carlo Tree Search}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In both tables are functions shown with their names and names of modules in
which they are placed. It is important to mention that if a function is called,
statistics of that function are not added to our cost centre from which the
function was called. This is important for a frequent calling
generatePiecesSteps, makeStep and generateMoveable from getValueByMC.
