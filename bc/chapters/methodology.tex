\chapter{Methodology}

At the begging of the work we decided to follow the consequent schedule:

\begin{enumerate}% {0}
\item Study possible and most used method used in Arimaa, Chess and Go bot development.
\item Develop basic versions of bots with plain versions of AlphaBeta search
and Monte Carlo Tree Search. However a work on bots is never ending so we will
try to develop two comparable bots and try to measure how changes in settings
affect their win:loss rate.
\item Improve both programs with enhances learned in first part of the process and tune variables of those enhances in order to improve the quality of both programs as much as possible.
\item Compare those engines playing offline matches and analyse the meaning of
obtained results.
% \item Analise engines time cost centres. Where are bottlenecks.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In order to obtain as much informations as possible we decided to run
tests consisting of these parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Test bots and enhances they uses by playing games with 3, 10, or 30 seconds
time limits per turn to test how different time limits affects their efficiency.
\item Playing games with Transposition Tables' size limited to 100MB, 200MB, or
400MB.
\item Playing engines using one, two, four, or eight cores.
% \item run AB to same level of search and give MCTS the same amount of time to play
\end{enumerate}
