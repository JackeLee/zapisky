\chapter{Methodology}

At the begging we decided to follow the consequent schedule:

\begin{enumerate}% {0}
\item Study possible and most used method used in Arimaa, Chess and Go.
\item Develop two arimaa playing programs using two earlier described
	  algorithms and all listed optimisatoin methods for them.
\item Compare those engines playing offline matches.
\item Analise engines time cost centres. Where are bottlenecks.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent By comparing engines we mean:

\begin{enumerate}
\item playing 3s/10s/30s per move time limit,
\item playing with transposition tables of size 100MB, 200MB, or 400MB,
\item using one, two, four, eight cores,
% \item run AB to same level of search and give MCTS the same amount of time to play
\end{enumerate}

Work on bot is never ending so we will try to develop two comparable bots and
try to measure how changes in settings affect their win:loss rate.
