\chapter{Methodology}
\begin{enumerate}% {0}
\item Study possible and most used method used in Arimaa, Chess and Go.
\item Develop two arimaa playing programs using two earlier described
	  algorithms and all listed optimisatoin methods for them.
\item Compare those engines playing offline matches.
\item Analise engines time cost centres. Where are bottlenecks.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item playing 3s/10s/30s time limit
\item playing with heap 100MB, 200MB, 400MB
\item using one, two, four, eight cores
\item run AB to same level of search and give MCTS the same amount of time to play
\end{enumerate}
If game ends to time limit we do not use/count its result into final statistics.

Work on bot is never ending so we try to develop two comparable bots and try to
measure how changes in settings affect their win:loss rate.
