Abstract = {{A software obfuscator transforms a program into another executable one
   with the same functionality but unreadable code implementation. This
   paper presents an algorithm of multi-stage software obfuscation method
   using improved virtual machine techniques. The key idea is to
   iteratively obfuscate a program for many times in using different
   interpretations. An improved virtual machine (VM) core is appended to
   the protected program for byte-code interpretation. Adversaries will
   need to crack all intermediate results in order to figure out the
   structure of original code. Compared with existing obfuscators, our new
   obfuscator generates the protected code which performs more efficiently,
   and enjoys proven higher level security.}},
