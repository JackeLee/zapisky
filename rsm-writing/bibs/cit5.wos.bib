Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce Event Identifier Logic (EIL), which extends
   Hennessy-Milner logic by the addition of:
   (1) reverse as well as forward modalities; and
   (2) identifiers to keep track of events.
   We show that this logic corresponds to hereditary history-preserving
   (HH) bisimulation equivalence within a particular true-concurrency
   model, namely, stable configuration structures. We also show how natural
   sublogics of EIL correspond to coarser equivalences. In particular, we
   provide logical characterisations of weak-history- preserving (WH) and
   history-preserving (H) bisimulation. Logics corresponding to HH and H
   bisimulation have been given previously, but none, as far as we are
   aware, corresponding to WH bisimulation (when autoconcurrency is
   allowed). We also present characteristic formulas that characterise
   individual structures with respect to history-preserving equivalences.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{431}},
Pages = {{13-39}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Membrane system computations proceed in a synchronous fashion: at each
   step all the applicable rules are actually applied. Hence each step
   depends on the previous one. This coarse view can be refined by looking
   at the dependencies among rule occurrences, by recording, for an object
   in a membrane and at a certain stage of the computation, which were the
   rules that produced it and subsequently (in a later step), which was the
   rule that consumed it. By recording the rules that have contributed to
   produce an object we can keep track of its history. Recording more than
   one rule for each object could be used to consider as equivalent some of
   the past histories, from the point of view of future use of this object.
   The other main ingredient in membrane system computations, namely the
   simultaneity in the rule applications, is usually enforced at the level
   of observation. We propose a way to look at it in a structural way. This
   is achieved using zero-safe nets that allows to synchronize transitions,
   i.e., rule occurrences. Zero-safe nets can be unfolded into causal nets
   in a classical way, and this unfolding can be manipulated to obtain a
   merged net where some histories could be considered as equivalent. To
   these notions of unfoldings, suitable event structures can be
   associated. The capability of capturing simultaneity of zero-safe nets
   is then transferred to the level of event structures by adding a way to
   express which events occur simultaneously. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We give a compositional event structure semantics of the pi-calculus.
   The main issues to deal with are the communication of free names and the
   extrusion of bound names. These are the source of the expressiveness of
   the pi-calculus, but they also allow subtle forms of causal
   dependencies. We show that free name communications can be modeled in
   terms of ``incomplete/potential synchronization{''} events. On the other
   hand, we argue that it is not possible to satisfactorily model parallel
   extrusion within the framework of stable event structures. We propose to
   model a process as a pair (E, X) where E is a prime event structure and
   X is a set of (bound) names. Intuitively, E encodes the structural
   causality of the process, while the set X affects the computation on E
   so as to capture the causal dependencies introduced by scope extrusion.
   The correctness of our true concurrent semantics is shown by an
   operational adequacy theorem with respect to the standard late semantics
   of the pi-calculus.}},

Abstract = {{In prime event structures with binary conflicts (pes-bc) 1 a branching
   cell {[}1] is a subset of events closed under downward causality and
   immediate conflict relations. This means that no event outside the
   branching cell can be in conflict with or enable any event inside the
   branching cell. It bears a strong resemblance to stubborn sets, a
   partial order reduction method on transition systems. A stubborn set (at
   a given state) is a subset of actions such that no execution consisting
   entirely of actions outside the stubborn set can be in conflict with or
   enable actions that are inside the stubborn set.
   A rigorous study of the relationship between the two ideas, however, is
   not straightforward due to the facts that 1) stubborn sets utilise
   sophisticated causality and conflict relations that invalidate the
   stability and coherence of event structures {[}18], 2) without stability
   it becomes very difficult to define concepts like prefixes and branching
   cells, which prerequire a clear notion of causality, and 3) it is
   challenging to devise a technique for identifying `proper' subsets of
   transitions as `events' such that the induced event-based system
   captures exactly the causality and conflict information needed by
   stubborn sets.
   In this paper we give a solution to the problems by providing an
   unfolding of labelled transition systems into configuration structures,
   a more general structure supporting or-causality and finite conflict. We
   show that the branching cell definition can be extended to configuration
   structures and that each branching cell in the unfolding is a long-lived
   stubborn set, such that no matter how the system evolves, what remains
   of the branching cell is always a stubborn set.}},

Abstract = {{We consider approaches for causal semantics of Petri nets, explicitly
   representing dependencies between transition occurrences. For one-safe
   nets or condition/event-systems, the notion of process as defined by
   Carl Adam Petri provides a notion of a run of a system where causal
   dependencies are reflected in terms of a partial order. A well-known
   problem is how to generalise tins notion for nets where places may carry
   several tokens. Goltz and Reisig have defined such a generalisation by
   distinguishing tokens according to their causal history. However, this
   so-called individual token interpretation is often considered too
   detailed. A number of approaches have tackled the problem of defining a
   more abstract notion of process, thereby obtaining a so-called
   collective token interpretation. Here we give a short overview on these
   attempts and then identify a subclass of Petri nets, called structural
   conflict nets, where the interplay between conflict and concurrency due
   to token multiplicity does not occur. For this subclass, we define
   abstract processes as equivalence classes of Goltz-Reisig processes. We
   justify this approach by showing that we obtain exactly one maximal
   abstract process if and only if the underlying net is conflict-free with
   respect to a canonical notion of conflict.}},
